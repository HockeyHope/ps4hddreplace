	<h2 id= "prep">Step 1: Preperation</h2>
	<p>The first step is making sure you have everything you need<p>
	<ul><p>Start State: You should already have a PS4, a controller and its charging cable. You will also need:</p>
		<p>A small Philips screwdriver</p>
		<p>The new hard drive that fits in PS4 (2.5 inch, 9.5 mm SATA II hard drive)</p>
		<p>Have a USB drive with enough space to back up your PS4 (the Systems Software is about 1 GB)</p>
		<p>End State: You have everything you need to replace the hard drive</p>
	</ul>

	<h2 id= "backup">Step 2: Backing It All Up</h2>
	<p>The second step is to get everything backed up to a safe spot. <p>
	<ul><p>Start State: All the pieces are laid out in front of you</p>
		<p>Stick the USB drive into one of the PS4’s USB slots to copy the save data</p>
		<p>Go to Settings >> Application Saved Data Management >> Saved Data in System Storage >> Copy to USB Storage Device >> Select your game saves you want to transfer >> Copy</p>
		<p>Next you’ll need to go to <a href="http://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/system-updates/ps4/#newinstallation" target="_blank">Sony’s website here </a> and download the System Software onto the USB drive (about 900 MB needed)</p>
		<p>End State: Everything is backed up</p>
	</ul>

	<h2 id= "apart">Step 3: Taking It Apart</h2>
	<p>The third step is to get the old hard drive pulled out of the PS4 <p>
	<ul><p>Start State: All supplies ready with the backed up USB drive</p>
		<p>First you will need to completely power off the PS4 and unplug it</p>
		<p>Gently slide off the top cover of the PS4</p>
		<p>Unscrew the single screw holding the hard drive case</p>
		<p>Unscrew the 4 screws of the hard drive cover to pull the hard drive out</p>
		<p>End State: Have all the pieces out and ready to put the new hard drive in</p>
	</ul>

	<h2 id= "together">Step 4: Putting It Back Together</h2>
	<p>The fourth step is to put the new hard drive into the PS4 <p>
	<ul><p>Start State: You will have all the pieces you just unscrewed in front of you</p>
		<p>Replace casing with the new hard drive</p>
		<p>Screw the 4 screws back in</p>
		<p>Slide the cover back in and screw it back on securely</p>
		<p>Slide the top cover of the PS4 back on</p>
		<p>End State: PS4 ready to plug back in and turn on</p>
	</ul>

	<h2 id= "finish">Step 5: Getting it set back up</h2>
	<p>The final step is to have the PS4 ready to play with new hard drive<p>
	<ul><p>Start State: PS4 with new hard drive in it and USB drive ready</p>
		<p>Plug PS4 back in and plug USB drive in it (plug controller directly into it as well)</p>
		<p>Turn it on by holding power button for 7 seconds (until it beeps 2 times)</p>
		<p>It will be in safe mode and select Initialize PS4 (Reinstall System Software) </p>
		<p>After it’s all rebooted. Sign back in. Go to Library and download your games back</p>
		<p>To recover saves from USB backup go to Application Saved Data Management >> Saved Data on USB Storage Device >> Copy to System Storage >> Select game >> Copy</p>
	</ul>
